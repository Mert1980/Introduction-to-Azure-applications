### What is the cloud?
Collection of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run apps, and deliver content such as email or videos.
 
Advantages:
- Cost: The cloud provider handles all the upfront costs associated with buying hardware, along with on-going maintenance costs
- Scale: Most are pay-as-you-go depending on demand (elasticity), and can be expanded as needed
- Reliability: Management of backups, disaster recovery, etc. is made easier
- Security: Policies and controls are already in place to protect your data

Disadvantages:
- It is internet-based, so it can be prone to outages and fluctuations in speed
Sensitive, private and core data is physically located on someone else's server
- Cloud services will be tailored and customized for your specific cloud instance, potentially making it hard to quickly change providers

## How to choose a region for a compute service?
There are three criteria:
- Service availability - Some services may not be available in a particular region.
- Performance - Latency determines network service performance; are you creating resources for yourself or your end user?
- Cost - Costs of services vary by region. If latency isnâ€™t an issue, you might want to deploy your services in the cheapest region.
